ADMIN MEDIA UPLOAD ISSUE FOUND
=================================

PROBLEM:
The admin page has file upload UI but cannot actually upload to Supabase Storage because it's missing the Media Manager script.

SOLUTION:
Add this line to admin/index.html after line 493:

CURRENT (line 491-494):
  <script src="../js/apartments-data.js"></script>
  <script src="../js/supabase-config.js"></script>
  <script src="js/admin-integrated-media.js"></script>

ADD THIS LINE:
  <script src="../js/apartments-data.js"></script>
  <script src="../js/supabase-config.js"></script>
  <script src="../js/supabase-media-manager.js"></script>   <!-- ADD THIS LINE -->
  <script src="js/admin-integrated-media.js"></script>

WHAT THIS FIXES:
1. ✅ Admin UI for file uploads exists
2. ✅ Supabase config is loaded  
3. ❌ Media Manager for actual uploads is missing → ✅ Will be added
4. ✅ Admin logic to handle UI exists

AFTER THIS FIX:
- You'll be able to drag & drop files in admin
- Files will upload to Supabase Storage buckets
- URLs will be saved to database
- Real media management will work

TEST STEPS AFTER FIX:
1. Open admin/index.html in browser
2. Go to Properties → Add Property
3. Try uploading an image in the "Main Image" section
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Verify files appear in Supabase Storage dashboard
