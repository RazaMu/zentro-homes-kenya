# Railway Domain Connection Guide for Namecheap
## Connecting zentrohomes.com to Railway Project

This guide walks you through connecting your Namecheap-purchased domain (zentrohomes.com) to your Railway project.

## Prerequisites
- Active Railway project with deployed application
- Domain purchased from Namecheap (zentrohomes.com)
- Access to Namecheap domain management panel
- Access to Railway project dashboard

## Step 1: Prepare Your Railway Project

1.1. **Ensure Your Project is Deployed**
   - Log into Railway dashboard (railway.app)
   - Navigate to your project
   - Confirm your application is successfully deployed and running
   - Note your Railway project URL (typically: https://[project-name]-production.up.railway.app)

1.2. **Upgrade to Pro Plan (If Needed)**
   - Custom domains require Railway Pro plan ($5/month)
   - Go to Settings > Plan in your Railway dashboard
   - Upgrade if currently on Hobby plan

## Step 2: Add Custom Domain in Railway

2.1. **Access Domain Settings**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your project
   - Click on your service/deployment
   - Navigate to "Settings" tab
   - Find "Custom Domain" or "Domains" section

2.2. **Add Your Domain**
   - Click "Add Domain" or similar button
   - Enter your domain: zentrohomes.com
   - Also add the www subdomain: www.zentrohomes.com
   - Railway will provide you with DNS records to configure

2.3. **Note the DNS Records**
   Railway will provide records similar to:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: @ (or zentrohomes.com)
   - Value: [your-project].up.railway.app
   
   - Type: CNAME  
   - Name: www
   - Value: [your-project].up.railway.app

## Step 3: Configure DNS in Namecheap

3.1. **Access Namecheap DNS Management**
   - Log into your Namecheap account
   - Go to "Domain List" in your dashboard
   - Click "Manage" next to zentrohomes.com
   - Navigate to "Advanced DNS" tab

3.2. **Clear Existing Records (If Any)**
   - Look for existing A records or CNAME records for @ and www
   - Delete any conflicting records
   - Keep MX records (email) if you need them

3.3. **Add Railway DNS Records**
   Add these records (replace [your-project] with actual Railway domain):

   Record 1:
   - Type: CNAME Record
   - Host: @
   - Value: [your-project].up.railway.app
   - TTL: Automatic (or 300)

   Record 2:
   - Type: CNAME Record
   - Host: www
   - Value: [your-project].up.railway.app
   - TTL: Automatic (or 300)

3.4. **Alternative A Record Method (If CNAME @ Doesn't Work)**
   Some DNS providers don't allow CNAME for root domain. If needed:
   - Get Railway's IP address from support or use a service like nslookup
   - Use A Record instead:
     - Type: A Record
     - Host: @
     - Value: [Railway's IP address]
     - TTL: Automatic

## Step 4: SSL Certificate Setup

4.1. **Railway Automatic SSL**
   - Railway automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains
   - This happens after DNS propagation (may take up to 24 hours)
   - Check "Domains" section in Railway to see certificate status

4.2. **Force HTTPS (Optional)**
   - In Railway settings, look for "Force HTTPS" option
   - Enable it to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS

## Step 5: Verification and Testing

5.1. **DNS Propagation Check**
   - DNS changes can take 5 minutes to 48 hours to propagate
   - Use online tools to check DNS propagation:
     - whatsmydns.net
     - dnschecker.org
   - Search for your domain and verify CNAME records point to Railway

5.2. **Test Your Domain**
   - Try accessing: http://zentrohomes.com
   - Try accessing: https://zentrohomes.com
   - Try accessing: http://www.zentrohomes.com
   - Try accessing: https://www.zentrohomes.com

5.3. **Verify SSL Certificate**
   - Once propagated, check that HTTPS works
   - Look for padlock icon in browser
   - Certificate should be issued by Let's Encrypt (Railway's provider)

## Step 6: Update Application Configuration

6.1. **Update Absolute URLs**
   - Check your HTML/CSS/JS files for any hardcoded URLs
   - Update from Railway domain to zentrohomes.com
   - Ensure all internal links use relative paths or new domain

6.2. **Update Meta Tags**
   - Update Open Graph tags in HTML
   - Update canonical URLs
   - Update any sitemap references

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### DNS Issues
- **Problem**: Domain doesn't resolve
- **Solution**: Wait longer for DNS propagation, verify DNS records are correct

### SSL Certificate Issues  
- **Problem**: SSL certificate not working
- **Solution**: Wait for auto-provisioning, contact Railway support if stuck

### Redirect Loops
- **Problem**: Too many redirects error
- **Solution**: Check Railway settings for redirect configurations

### Subdomain Issues
- **Problem**: www subdomain not working
- **Solution**: Ensure both @ and www CNAME records are added

## Important Notes

1. **Backup Current Setup**: Before making changes, note current DNS settings
2. **Email Impact**: Changing DNS may affect email if you have MX records
3. **Propagation Time**: Allow up to 24 hours for full DNS propagation
4. **Railway Limits**: Free plans have limitations on custom domains
5. **HTTPS Only**: Modern browsers prefer HTTPS, ensure certificate works

## Post-Setup Checklist

□ Domain resolves to Railway application
□ Both zentrohomes.com and www.zentrohomes.com work  
□ HTTPS certificate is active and valid
□ All website features work on new domain
□ Internal links and assets load correctly
□ Search engines can access the site (check robots.txt)
□ Analytics/tracking codes updated with new domain

## Contact Information

If you encounter issues:
- Railway Support: help.railway.app
- Namecheap Support: Through your Namecheap account
- DNS Propagation Tools: Use online checkers for verification

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Keep Railway project private/secure
- Monitor domain for unauthorized changes
- Consider setting up monitoring for uptime
