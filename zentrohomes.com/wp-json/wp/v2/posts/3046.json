Savills estimate that the South East and East of England will both see prices rise by 9.3%.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the report, Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, said that house prices in these areas were recovering more slowly from the financial crisis than London.<\/p>\n<p>\"Brexit angst is a major factor for market sentiment right now, particularly in London. But it is the legacy of the global financial crisis - mortgage regulation in particular - combined with gradually rising interest rates that will really shape the market over the longer term,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Five-year forecasts in any market must be treated with caution and particularly in the housing market, owing to the variety of events that can affect the UK economy and the sector, including significant variations at local level.<\/p>\n<p>The past five years have seen regional fluctuations but overall relatively little activity in the housing market. Last week, the Nationwide Building Society said that many homeowners were choosing to stay put, leading to relatively few properties being placed on the market.<\/p>\n<p>The predictions by Savills suggest that, across Britain, house prices will increase by an average of 4.8% over the five years from 2019. That would add about \u00a332,000 to the average property value, taking it to \u00a3248,086.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3052 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/manchester-2488681_960_720.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"685\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Cities such as Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham are predicted to outperform their regions.<\/p>\n<p>To take advantage of existing and forthcoming high quality investment opportunities in Yorkshire,\u00a0 the Midlands and Lancashire, contact Tom at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact Us<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The next few months maybe the optimum time to invest in buy to let property in the North of England.
