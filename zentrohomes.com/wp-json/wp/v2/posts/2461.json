Because the maximum amount that he will be prepared to lend will be based on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">his<\/span> valuation unless you can persuade him otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>The lender\u2019s valuation of the amount of prospective rental return is also crucial in calculating the maximum amount that he is prepared to loan.<\/p>\n<p>The following is an example of a typical formula that a lender might use: -<\/p>\n<p>Amount of loan\u00a0times \u201cnominal\u201d interest rate (5% has been a typical rate used by lenders) divided by 12, then multiplied by\u00a0125%<\/p>\n<p>equals the minimum amount of rental income required per month to cover the monthly mortgage payments i.e.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Amount of loan = \u00a3100,000;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u201cNominal\u201d cost = (\u00a31000,000 x 5%) - \u00a35000<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Divided by 12 = \u00a3416.67<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Times 125% = \u00a3520.83<\/p>\n<p>This is the minimum monthly amount of rental income which the lender will accept for loaning an amount of \u00a3100,000.\u00a0 The lender will then review the market for similar buy-to-let properties and will\u00a0estimate the expected amount of rental income that your property might attract - if the estimate is under\u00a0\u00a3520 per month, then the amount of loan will be reduced accordingly or the offer of a mortgage declined entirely.<\/p>\n<h3>How much Deposit?<\/h3>\n<p>But how much deposit will you need to put down to meet the lender\u2019s requirements?<\/p>\n<p>20% is a typical minimum (i.e. \u00a324,000 on a property valued at \u00a3124,000.).\u00a0 An experienced mortgage broker with good contacts may very occasionally be able to negotiate a lower deposit in certain circumstances but you should assume a 20% figure as an absolute minimum.<\/p>\n<p>Dependent on various factors a larger deposit may be required in individual circumstances and remember the higher the deposit then generally the better the interest rate that will apply.<\/p>\n<h3>What rate can I expect to pay?<\/h3>\n<p>Okay let\u2019s assume that you have met the lender\u2019s criteria and you are able to proceed.\u00a0 No doubt you will have seen in the press or on the internet headlines indicating that mortgage rates have never been cheaper and you may confidently be expecting to stroll into your local building society and secure a deal for the headline rate advertised in the branch window.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you have been very lucky in the selection of your property you could be in for another shock.<\/p>\n<p>Lenders apply very strict criteria when determining the rate at which they are prepared to lend. \u00a0For example, the best rates might not apply if the property you have chosen is a \u201cnew build\u201d or above a shop or is a flat within a tall tower block, or maybe on a main road or adjacent to pubs and restaurants or is a leasehold property with less than seventy-five years of lease remaining.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, if you are a first time investor and\/or over age 50 or have a deposit of \u201conly\u201d 25% or 30% you will find that the best rates are normally denied to you.\u00a0 Come back when you\u2019ve scraped together a 40% or 50% deposit and you might be luckier!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2502\" src=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/hand-819279_1280.jpg\" alt=\"hand-819279_1280\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Getting the best deal<\/h3>\n<p>What can you do to secure the highest amount of loan at the best rate?\u00a0 Sadly, there is no magic wand but getting expert advice <em>at the outset<\/em> from a property expert and a mortgage broker is likely to give you a better chance than trying to tackle this complex market on your own.<\/p>\n<p>One of our key recommendations is that you consult the experts <em>before <\/em>you get too far down\u00a0the line in searching for a property.\u00a0 With the assistance of our panel of high quality and experienced tax, legal and mortgage advisers we can help you choose the best type of property in the most suitable location and on the best financial terms to maximise your investment return.<\/p>\n<p>For more information or to book a free initial consultation please call 020 7205 4060 or email tom@sourceinvestments.com \u00a0or visit <a href=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/\">sourceinvestments.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Deposit and Mortgage If you are thinking of purchasing a residential property and then renting it out, a popular way of financing the arrangement is\u00a0with a deposit plus a \u201cbuy-to-let\u201d mortgage (normally provided on an interest only basis).
