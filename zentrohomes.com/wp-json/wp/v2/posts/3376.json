From a 2008 gripped by the global financial crisis to a 2018 mired in the political quagmire of Brexit.<\/p>\n<p>During 2008 when the economic crisis and the collapse of financial markets across the globe were really beginning to bite house prices fell by 16%. There was a small bounce back during 2009 and 2010 but the UK housing market didn\u2019t start to gain real momentum until 2013 as economic growth accelerated. Prices are now 14.5% higher than the previous peak of the market in 2007.<\/p>\n<p>In 2008 the average house price was \u00a3153,048, in 2018 it had increased to \u00a3212,281 an increase of \u00a359,233 (38%).<\/p>\n<p>During 2008 house prices fell by an average of 15.9% whereas in 2018 prices rose by an average of 0.5%.<\/p>\n<p>Annual sales volumes were 916,920 in 2008 and 1,192,280 in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>The number of first-time buyers in 2008 were 180,100, whereas in 2018 there were 339,700.<\/p>\n<p>Despite Government commitments to significantly increase the number of new builds the net additional dwellings built in 2018 (222,190) was fewer than the figure for 2008 (223,530).<\/p>\n<p>In 2018 the average mortgage rate on a 5-year fixed arrangement (with 75% LTV) was 2.02% compared to 5.28% in 2008.<\/p>\n<p>It is difficult to make too much of \u201csnapshot\u201d figures such as the above, but they do indicate the resilience of the market over a medium to long term. Despite the dramatic fall in prices of 16% during 2008 the market had by 2018 recovered by an average of 14.5% from prices before the fall. An investor buying at the end of 2018 would have achieved an average increase of 38% if they had sold in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>For further help or information on residential property investment please <a href=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/contact-us\/\">get in touch.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>High end Estate Agents Knight Frank have produced some interesting statistics looking at how the UK\u2019s property market has changed from a decade ago.
