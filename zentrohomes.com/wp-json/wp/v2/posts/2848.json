Thorough research and planning before purchase is always essential to determine whether the property represents good value for money for rental purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Location is paramount \u2013 depending on the target type of tenant proximity to transport links (for professionals), schools (for families), hospitals (for nurses\/doctors) or universities (for students) will ensure that a plentiful range of tenants will be available. Determining the type of tenant you intend to rent to will drive the type and location of the property you need to purchase.<\/p>\n<p>We have great experience in helping potential landlords find the best properties for buy to let\u00a0investments.<\/p>\n<h3>How to get maximum rent<\/h3>\n<p>Like any other market the rental market is driven by supply and demand. However, to give yourself the best opportunity of getting the highest rent you should endeavour to maintain the property in as good a condition as possible.<\/p>\n<p>A good management agent will help by conducting regular inspections of the property. They\u00a0will check that the tenants are adhering to the terms of the lease and respecting the property and flag up any problems or defects that need sorting out.\u00a0 Early correction of problems is likely to be\u00a0much cheaper\u00a0than allowing a problem to further deteriorate.<\/p>\n<p>A good management agent will also ensure that the property is professionally cleaned after each change of tenancy (or annually if the tenancy is for a two or three-year period) and redecorated regularly.<\/p>\n<h3>Source Investments<\/h3>\n<p>Source Investments offer a nationwide property sourcing and management service which will ensure you attract a high quality of tenant at the maximum rent and will maintain your investment properties to the highest standards.<br \/>\nFor more information get in touch at <a href=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/contact-us\/\">https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/contact-us\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cost and Location are\u00a0top of tenants requirements No surprise but cost and location are the two key factors that influence property choices for more than four out of five tenants when choosing a rental property according to a survey undertaken by Cover4LetProperty.
