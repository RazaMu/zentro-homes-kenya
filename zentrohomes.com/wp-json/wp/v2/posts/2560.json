In Zone 3, particularly, established but hard-to-get-to places like Tooting Broadway and Wimbledon will see a good jump in house prices. But the reality is that all the areas with Crossrail 2 stations will benefit.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">However, those parts of the line which are already classed as \u201cunaffordable\u201d based on the average salary of London residents, may see smaller percentage increases than the average overall increase for the route.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Lessons from Crossrail 1<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">One of the good things about Crossrail 2 is that investors have the Elizabeth line as a guide as to how house and land prices may change as the project develops. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Many experts argue that one of the mistakes made in the planning for Crossrail 1 was that housing wasn\u2019t given enough attention early enough. Crossrail 2 has learned from this and there is immense potential with predictions that around 200,000 new homes will be built.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Such a figure can only realistically be achieved by building high-density housing [typically blocks of flats and tower blocks] which will be welcomed in many areas but is likely to meet resistance in out of town areas and will possibly be thwarted by green belt restrictions.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>A three stage project<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Stage 1 is the planning and it is at this stage that the bravest investors get involved with relevant areas getting an early uplift from speculators well before the decision to proceed\u00a0receives a\u00a0100 per cent guarantee. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Indeed, there\u00a0is evidence that activity is already happening. Developers have been purchasing land along the route, much of which they will sit on until the time is right to offer it to house builders and developers at a profit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Such deals are being done off the back of notional investment in the hope that even if Crossrail 2 doesn\u2019t come off, there is value in the land anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Stage 2 starts when physical construction begins and will inevitably trigger another wave of buyer activity of both land and existing property.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Stage 3 is when the more conservative investors and home buyers get involved, those who will wait until the project nears completion (2033 in this case) before moving in to take advantage of the final upsurge in land values and house prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Crossrail 2 Property Hot Spots<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Any area through which Crossrail 2 will run, and in which the average price of a home is still below the \u00a3300,000 mark, is likely to see big increases.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Those stations clustered together at the north of the route such as Cheshunt, Waltham Cross, Enfield Lock, Brimsdown, Ponders Edge and Angel Row are all examples of where this might happen.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">In the southern end of the line local agents are expecting significant increase if Crossrail 2 goes ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Shepperton for example where the average sale price has climbed from \u00a3300,000 in November 2012 to \u00a3347,000 in November 2015 still has some way to go and\u00a0almost certainly\u00a0some bargains to be had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">In Twickenham where the average house price is \u00a3506,930, (an 87 per cent increase in the past 10 years) predictions are that prices could rise by more than \u00a3200,000.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">In nearby Hampton Court, the average house price could rise by \u00a3150,000, having already risen by 45 per cent since 2004. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">In Kingston, the potential increase could average 30 per cent to \u00a3460,000. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Whilst in Surbiton there could be a rise of \u00a3130,000 and in Chessington a rise of around \u00a3100,000 by 2020. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">House prices in Wimbledon, Epsom and Motspur Park could all increase by more than \u00a3100,000 if included in the final\u00a0plans. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Should I Invest Now?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Whilst Investing blindly in any area on the Crossrail 2 route is probably not a good idea, there are currently many good investment opportunities that are likely to remain available only for a finite period.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">To get the best of the bargains early investment is likely to pay off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Get in touch with our expert team for<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span
