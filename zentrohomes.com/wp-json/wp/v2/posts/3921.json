We understand \u00a0that in order to get to know a place until you got to immerse yourself in it.<\/p>\n<p>A great perk of our job \u00a0is we get to travel around awesome cities. We meet local people and find out about what it is that makes their area stand out.<\/p>\n<p>The Steel City was home to one of our developments in 2017 and a really successful one. We had the chance to visit last week to see how things have changed. It seems silly not to share some of the great and exciting places that we discovered.<\/p>\n<p>So here's our definitive guide to what to do, where to eat \u00a0where to find the best coffee in the Steel City.<\/p>\n<h2>What to do!<\/h2>\n<h3>Kelham Island Museum<\/h3>\n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-left\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4E12AQG_lnGYRKyRsA\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=qkvfWdTT07GGJOUdw7Zi1bBmovuZvV1sXXlssp0jiIY\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4E12AQG_lnGYRKyRsA\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=qkvfWdTT07GGJOUdw7Zi1bBmovuZvV1sXXlssp0jiIY\" \/><\/div>\n<p>To fully appreciate Sheffield you need to understand its industrial heritage. Kelham Island Museum will give you all the info and will help you understand the significance of the streets and business names that you may not otherwise notice.<\/p>\n<h3>Kelham Island<\/h3>\n<p>Kelham Island itself is the sort of place we dream about. If you like independent culture this is where you need to be: set aside some time to explore. It was once the industrial heart of the city, but the brownfield sites have now been rejuvenated into shops, bars, and cafes. Don't rush, don't plan, and check every side street; there's something around every corner.<\/p>\n<h3>Winter Gardens<\/h3>\n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-right\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQEtS3hAB6v2Tg\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Rglpeil9sjkYfNl4J6v9bFGaEeJHgbNZHbEvU6WsrWM\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQEtS3hAB6v2Tg\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Rglpeil9sjkYfNl4J6v9bFGaEeJHgbNZHbEvU6WsrWM\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If it rains, get yourself to the Winter Gardens. It is the largest urban glasshouse in Europe and is home to over 2,500 varieties of plants. The Millennium Gallery which adjoins the gardens is back open now, so you can get your art fix here too.<\/p>\n<p>If you're into your street photography don't forget your camera. From the north exit, you'll find Tudor Square and the architecturally stunning Crucible and Lyceum theatres. From the south, you'll walk straight into the city's Peace Gardens. (And you are only a short walk from Marmadukes Cafe which is a huge bonus!)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Five Weirs Walk<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-left\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQH9ZsZxCHvZzA\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ioJ-H4dkUFAyuyzWIuRl84_NlfZa-adNficaDyKXxWs\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQH9ZsZxCHvZzA\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ioJ-H4dkUFAyuyzWIuRl84_NlfZa-adNficaDyKXxWs\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Sheffield is fondly called the 'Outdoor City', and it's the only major city with a national park (the Peak District) within its boundary. The stunning five weirs walk along the river Don takes you from Meadowhall to the city centre. It is one of the UK's best-loved river walks, and it's easy to see why: you'll find history aplenty as well as kingfishers, grayling, and if you're really lucky - otters!<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Where to eat - and where to get great coffee!<\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Cutlery Works<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-right\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQHVUQGJI-1-sA\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=07X97SmGlUEAJuNChQEPr7QRLwEL3i-O8uUcT9o2tCI\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQHVUQGJI-1-sA\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=07X97SmGlUEAJuNChQEPr7QRLwEL3i-O8uUcT9o2tCI\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Welcome to foodie heaven. Here you'll find 11 different independent street food offerings, including a coffee roaster and a chocolatier. You'll be spoilt for choice! Either go more than once or don't eat for a week beforehand, whichever suits you. You'll see \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Tamper Sellers Wheel<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This place is coffee paradise, but it nails the food too. It's kiwi-inspired and reminds me a lot of Ozone near Old Street. If you are planning a brunch trip go here; you will not be disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Marmadukes<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-left\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQFn9Ynueagz7Q\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=vBnM581vP7mySxOtk7cQW-BLjNgY4Hbe6C6-j_m8sOM\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQFn9Ynueagz7Q\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1605139200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=vBnM581vP7mySxOtk7cQW-BLjNgY4Hbe6C6-j_m8sOM\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Right in the heart of the city centre, this place is great and we always make a visit when we're \u00a0in town. I actually wrote this blog whilst sat in their outside space and eating this delicious granola.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Night Owl?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Public<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>One of the great speakeasies; you've probably already walked passed it a thousand times. These reimagined public toilets are now the hottest ticket in town! Those of you who love your interior design - don't miss this one. The cocktail glasses, the bar stools, even the toilets are perfectly curated. Don't believe me?
