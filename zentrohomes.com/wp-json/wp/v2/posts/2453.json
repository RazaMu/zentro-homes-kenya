Selling in a \u201cslow\u201d market can take a long time or mean a significant discount in price so careful planning to avoid a financial disappointment is essential.<\/p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Unless you are an expert \u2013 stick to areas you know!<\/h3>\n<p>If you are a first time buyer it is normally sensible to buy in an area that you know well.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t always mean that you have to buy only close to where you live \u2013 you may know a holiday area very well or have relatives or friends who have lived somewhere for many years and who you can trust to give you reliable information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are planning to maintain the property yourself and to find your own tenants it obviously makes sense to buy and let a property which is in a reasonable travelling distance.\u00a0 If you choose\u00a0to invest in a property which is a long way from home it is probably sensible to appoint an agent to manage the property and tenant find on your behalf.<\/p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Understanding value<\/h3>\n<p>You won't know if you are investing at too\u00a0high a price\u00a0if you don\u2019t research the rental\/sales market thoroughly.<\/p>\n<p>Are you seeking rental return or capital growth?<\/p>\n<p>Of course it is the aim of every investor to achieve both but deciding at the outset which is the <em>primary<\/em> requirement is vital in ensuring that you buy the right type of property in the right location to maximise your financial return.<\/p>\n<p>Buying primarily for capital growth generally carries a higher risk because there are so many variables which can influence property prices and many of these will be out of your individual control \u2013 i.e. mortgage rates; general economic influences such as a recession, political decisions (such as Brexit), local situations such as a planned development being cancelled or moved to a different location etc.<\/p>\n<p>Buying primarily for rental return is normally less risky because it is easier to forecast whether a specific location is likely to continue to be a popular area for rental demand (near to a hospital or railway station for example) and although outside influences can impact on the amount of return the impact is likely to be more manageable.<\/p>\n<h3>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Know your budget<\/h3>\n<p>As part of the planning process and certainly before you commit any expenditure it is essential that you know your budget and\u00a0fully understand\u00a0all the various costs involved.<\/p>\n<p>If you need to finance your investment with a mortgage find out first what deposit you will require; the maximum amount of mortgage you are able to borrow and what the repayment costs will be - a good mortgage broker will be a significant help in sifting through the options and finding the best deal.<\/p>\n<p>Also don\u2019t overlook the other costs involved.<\/p>\n<p>Costs breakdown into set up \u2013 stamp duty, legal and financing fees, estate agents fees etc. and ongoing\u2013 maintaining the property; cost of finding tenants; agents fees; tax charges; insurance,\u00a0mortgage repayment costs etc.<\/p>\n<p>Carefully work out whether the estimated rental return will cover the costs allowing for possible increases in mortgage rates; dormant periods (when no rent is received because of a time lag between one tenant leaving and another starting); repair costs etc.<\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2458\" src=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/help-1276257_1920.jpg\" alt=\"Investing\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" \/>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If in doubt\u2026ask for Help!<\/h3>\n<p>Expert help and guidance in Buy-to-Let investment is available from many sources so it is sensible to talk to the experts before committing.<\/p>\n<p>At Source Investments we are happy to provide an initial consultancy meeting completely free of charge and without any strings attached.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to go forward with us we provide a private and personal service that gives expert and impartial advice and also stay with you through every step of your investment journey.
