The more tenants you have the less likely you are to fall foul of cash-flow problems if your one tenant fails you.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2321\" src=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/coffee-1128140_1920-1.jpg\" alt=\"coffee-1128140_1920\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1431\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Property Investment Tips:<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Seek advice from and use the services of truly independent, experienced and recommended professionals when you need it. Use your own surveyor, agent, accountant, solicitor, insurance and financial advisor.<\/p>\n<p>Be very wary about \"too good to be true schemes\" peddled by slick salesmen\u00a0 such as\u00a0expensive property investment club memberships, no money down deals, gifted deposits, cash backs and claims of discounted properties etc.<\/p>\n<p>Check comparable property values in the area, occupancy rates and rental demand and where you can avoid large developments or developments where there are too many properties to-let or for sale to sustain value.<\/p>\n<p>If you are buying off-plan from developers get some good advice about contracts.<\/p>\n<p>Also if\u00a0you buy abroad it is advisable to use advisor's who speak the language, know the local markets and laws legislation and\u00a0come with good references and an honest reputation.<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Capital Growth versus Rental Income<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Landlords will typically invest for a combination of capital growth and rental income. Some properties and locations may provide a higher rental yield but lower long term growth and others the opposite so you need to have a plan in mind about whether your <em>primary<\/em> requirement is income or growth. As growth is more problematic because property markets don\u2019t always behave as predicted the lower risk is to focus on a strong rental yield that overs your overall costs and gives you a regular net profit.<\/p>\n<p>Our clients are not short-term speculators wanting to sell on quickly to make a quick buck!
