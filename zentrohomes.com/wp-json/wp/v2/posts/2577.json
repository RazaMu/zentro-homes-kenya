This will bring Sheffield and potentially Chesterfield into the heart of the HS2 route and is bound to impact on property values and rents in the region.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Improved connectivity<\/strong> with London and the other Northern powerhouse centres, particularly Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, will enhance the significant city centre development already going forward in Sheffield and will make the city <strong>a major player<\/strong> going forward.<\/p>\n<p>The government has already announced big plans for Sheffield and is proposing to invest \u00a3328m by 2021.<\/p>\n<p>In addition Sichuan Guodong (a major Chinese manufacturing firm) will invest more than \u00a31bn in Sheffield over the next 60 years, including around \u00a3220m by 2019. \u00a0This money, which is the <strong>biggest Chinese investment deal in UK outside of London<\/strong>, will mostly be invested in building new hotels, leisure and residential properties.<\/p>\n<p>Wang Chunming, Sichuan Guodong\u2019s chairman, has personally visited Sheffield on numerous occasions and previously said it has \u201creal growth potential\".<\/p>\n<h3>Night Tube impact on Zones 2 and 3<\/h3>\n<p>Much further south, London\u2019s new <strong>Night Tube<\/strong> is likely to push property and rental prices up by as much as 10% in some areas, on top of general rates of growth.<\/p>\n<p>Research undertaken by Sellmyhome.co.uk and Dataloft, calculated that homes within a half mile radius of stations in zones 2 and 3 will benefit most from the new service in terms of prices.<\/p>\n<p>Landlords will inevitably see <strong>increased demand and rental prices<\/strong>, as young professionals, students and shift workers are drawn to areas with better night time transport links.<\/p>\n<p>Although night buses already run across the capital many are significantly overcrowded.\u00a0 The new underground service will provide faster routes and help ease congestion above ground.<\/p>\n<p>Travellers will be able to use day travel cards from the previous day up until 4.30 am and once fully phased in next year\u00a0the Night Tube\u00a0will provide a comprehensive service across the capital (before being extended to the Docklands Light Railway by 2021).<\/p>\n<p>According to the research the ten areas most likely to see the highest rent increases are<\/p>\n<p>Stratford, Willesden Green, Mile End, Canada Water, North Acton, Turnpike Lane, Leytonstone, North Greenwich, Bermondsey and Acton Town.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The evidence seems clear that for landlords Investing in Travel is a smart move.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For further information about our range of Landlord and property investment services please get in touch through <a href=\"https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/contact-us\/\">https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/contact-us\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why for Landlords Investing in travel makes sense.
