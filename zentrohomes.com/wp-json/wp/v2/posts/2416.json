It therefore proposes measures to assess the investor's ability to cope with rising interest rates.<\/p>\n<p>It proposes that lenders:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>consider the likely future interest rates over a minimum of five years from the start of the contract or for the duration of the contract if less than five years.<\/li>\n<li>carry out interest 'stress tests' based on market expectations and a calculation based on a minimum increase of two percentage points and any Financial Policy Committee (FPC) direction or recommendation.<\/li>\n<li>Assume a minimum borrower interest rate of 5.5% even if the stress tests indicate a lower rate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Portfolio landlords<\/h3>\n<p>Portfolio landlords will be defined as those who have four or more buy-to-let properties.<\/p>\n<p>Data shows that there is an increase in observed arrears rates of landlords with buy-to-let portfolios of four or more, the PRA said.<\/p>\n<p>The PRA proposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investors with four or more properties would be considered a portfolio landlord.<\/li>\n<li>Firms should introduce a special underwriting process for portfolio landlords that accounts for the complex nature of the borrower and their properties.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Firms should also have robust risk management, systems and controls in place specifically tailored for buy-to-let properties, it is proposed.<\/p>\n<p>The consultation on these proposals for tighter rules on mortgage lending closes on Wednesday, June 29.<\/p>\n<h3>About Source<\/h3>\n<p>Source specialises in helping new and existing landlords find the best buy to let investment opportunities.
