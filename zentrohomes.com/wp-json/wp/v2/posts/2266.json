At least 3,750 homes will be built on an 85-acre former gas works bordering Grand Union Canal.<\/p>\n<p>Because<strong> Ealing Broadway<\/strong> will be directly connected to the West End, City and Canary Wharf employment centres it is tipped to become a better investment than nearby Chiswick.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Acton<\/strong> is becoming popular with young renters and buyers who can\u2019t afford Hammersmith or Shepherd\u2019s Bush, but\u00a0want to be\u00a0well\u00a0connected.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Central<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Farringdon station<\/strong> in Clerkenwell which will be the only London terminus with integrated north-south (of the river) and east-west routes) is poised for huge growth with a projected sevenfold increase in commuters.\u00a0 Not only will it allow passengers to board Crossrail, Thameslink and London Underground trains but will also provide direct links to Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and London City airports as well as to Eurostar services at St Pancras and Brighton on the south coast.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Paddington<\/strong>\u2019s new Crossrail station will create a 17-minute commute to Canary Wharf - at a price! - \u00a0two-bedroom flats are from around\u00a0\u00a3800,000, and houses from about \u00a32.5 million<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>East<\/h4>\n<p>Poplar will now be linked direct to Canary Wharf Crossrail station and although prices are 15-20% higher than a year ago they still offer an attractive financial alternative to the significantly higher prices in central London.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Royal Docks<\/strong> one of London\u2019s main regeneration and housing growth areas will get a huge boost from Crossrail which will connect with Tottenham Court Road\u00a0in only 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Abbey Wood <\/strong>on the Crossrail southern spur into Greenwich which is currently a desolate, isolated and relatively cheap south London outpost has the potential to become a serious commuter zone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Woolwich<\/strong> remains one of the cheapest places to live in London but when the station opens in 2018, no other place beyond Zone 1 in south London will be as well-connected.\u00a0\u00a0Ex-local authority flats in Woolwich start at less than \u00a3125,000 (see below).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stratford<\/strong> will be reclassified next year as Zone 2 whilst <strong>Maryland <\/strong>which merges into Leytonstone offers local property prices around 30-35% below the London average.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Forest Gate,<\/strong> <strong>Manor Park <\/strong>and <strong>Ilford<\/strong> will all come within approximately 20 to 25 minutes journey time of Tottenham Court Road and under an hour to Heathrow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seven Kings, Goodmayes <\/strong>and<strong> Chadwell Heath<\/strong> house some of the capital\u2019s cheapest homes whilst at the other end of the scale <strong>Gidea Park<\/strong> is an original Edwardian garden suburb, with small cottages and houses in an attractive setting adjoining golf courses and woodland.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Brentwood <\/strong>has a wealthy, rural feel with a traditional high street, old fashioned independent shops and a monthly farmers\u2019 market but will be less than 30 minutes from\u00a0the City by Crossrail.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shinfield<\/strong> right at the end of the Crossrail line, is leafy, prosperous and great for families<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2269\" src=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/electrician-1080554_1920.jpg\" alt=\"electrician-1080554_1920\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1277\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Follow the Developer<\/h3>\n<p>Crossrail is owned by Transport for London but is partly funded by developers who will inevitably want to cash in on their investment.<\/p>\n<p>For example Berkeley Homes has contributed \u00a330 million towards the \u00a3100 million Crossrail station at Royal Arsenal Riverside in <strong>Woolwich<\/strong> and are developing 394 flats in five towers above the Crossrail station.
