All be it that the increase is \"patchy\", with only London, the South East, the South West and Yorkshire and the Humber seeing above-average increases in stock. In the West Midlands, stock is down and the North West and Wales have only seen small stock increases\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The most common property types coming up for sale were those with two bedrooms or fewer \u2013 typically sought by first-time buyers \u2013 with the number of such new properties up by 10 per cent on this time last year.<\/p>\n<p>Rightmove also claim that 2016 could end up being \u201cthe year of the first-time buyer\u201d due to the increased supply of such properties, combined with \u201clow interest rates, initiatives such as \u201chelp to buy\u201d, and buy-to-let investors facing increasingly adverse taxes\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Rightmove director Miles Shipside said the increase in these property types coming to market could be due to a wave of first-time sellers putting their homes on the market ahead of a stamp duty increase for buy-to-let investors in April 2016.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2389\" src=\"https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/calculator-1044173_1920.jpg\" alt=\"Buy to let\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #993366;\">UK Interest Rates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Latest information from financial media organisation Bloomberg is that financial markets now believe there is only a 50% chance that the Bank of England will cut rates this year<\/p>\n<p>Some investors even believe that UK interest rates will remain on hold until August 2019 (which would mean over a decade of record low rates) although this was robustly contradicted by Sir Jon Cunliffe the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for financial stability who said that such views were just \u201cplain wrong\u201d. Cunliffe remains at odds with the consensus city view that no increase will occur this year.<\/p>\n<p>Only last month, Morgan Stanley\u2019s closely-watched index, which compiles traders\u2019 bets on interest rates, showed the Bank\u2019s base rate was likely to rise from 0.5pc as early as October this year.<\/p>\n<p>The extraordinary reverse on predictions came following a warning from US Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen that the continuing downturn in the world economy coupled with the recent volatility in financial markets might mean that US interest rates will stay low for longer. Only just over a month ago the US central bank had raised its rates by a quarter of a percentage \u2013 the first increase for nearly a decade.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe economic outlook is uncertain,\u201d she told Congress, noting that investors \u201chave become fearful about a recession\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The expectation that the US Federal Reserve will delay further rate hikes combined with the decision of the Bank of Japan in January to introduce negative rates and dovish messages from the European Central Bank have pushed back expectations for UK interest rates.<\/p>\n<p>Further evidence that any rate hike will be deferred also came from Gareth Ramsay, the Bank of England\u2019s head of monetary analysis who told Reuters that \u201cthe Bank have started to hear from businesses that low inflation is affecting some businesses' pay. That's a real amber warning light for us, a really important message. We really want to be well-sighted on that area and there's no official data source that's going to tell you that.\"<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile Mr. Ramsay\u2019s boss, Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England said that \u201can unforgiving global environment was likely to weigh on Britain\u2019s recovery and keep inflation well below the Bank's 2pc target in the near-term\u201d. However asked last week if he believed the next move in interest rates was more likely to be up than down, he replied \u201cabsolutely\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The probability of a continuation of the record low bank rate means that competitive mortgage rates will continue to be available for the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Lending to Landlords Slowed in December<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The latest monthly lending information released by the Council of Mortgage Lender's this week showed that gross buy-to-let lending fell around 3% both by volume and value compared to November.<\/p>\n<p>This is a surprise given that there is an expectation of increased activity in the rush to beat the looming stamp duty surcharge on investment properties.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the December downturn gross buy-to-let lending still rose 28% by volume year-on-year and 39% by value to hit its highest level since 2007.<\/p>\n<p>Views are mixed on whether this dip in month to month figures suggests that the wheels might finally be coming off the\u00a0buy-to-let wagon or is just a pre-Christmas blip. Until a consistent trend can be established most analysts agree that there is no reason to panic.<\/p>\n<p>Jonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris was not alone in condemning \"the succession of draconian measures introduced by the Government\u201d and said they will hit demand, especially from more speculative investors. But those landlords who are looking for long-term investments are unlikely to either sell up on masse or desert the sector in droves.\"<\/p>\n<p>David Whittaker, managing director of Mortgages for Business,\u00a0blamed\u00a0the slowdown on the sluggish winter months.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe buy-to-let sector still accounts for around 18% of the overall mortgage market, a remarkably steady performance compared to previous years.\"<\/p>\n<p>Jeremy Duncombe, director, Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, said:\u00a0\u201cWith the new stamp duty changes now firmly on the horizon, buy-to-let lending is likely to spike due to a surge in demand in the first few months of 2016.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The big question is what happens to buy-to-let\u00a0after the surcharge kicks in on 1 April.<\/p>\n<p>Duncombe said he expected the lack of supply will continue to limit choice and drive homebuyer demand\u00a0after 1 April, keeping prices high.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2489\" src=\"https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/london-1018629_1920.jpg\" alt=\"london-1018629_1920\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #993366;\">One million more families now renting <\/span><\/h3>\n<p>According to the government's latest English housing survey the number of families privately renting homes has increased by one million in the last 10 years which brings the total figure to 1.6 million households, an increase of 50pc over the previous five years.<\/p>\n<p>Some analysts suggest that the significant rise of families renting shows that renting will no longer be applicable just to young professionals and also raises questions about the availability of appropriate properties in the sector. Particularly as the figures also reveal that the percentage of people who privately rent and expect to buy in the future has declined from 61pc in 2013-14 to 57pc in 2014-15, a seven-year low.<\/p>\n<p>However many analysts are urging caution before jumping to the conclusion that this is a long term trend particularly as other information included in the survey suggests that the long-term decline in home ownership has paused in the last year, with 64pc of households being owner-occupiers. This bucks a trend of decline that began in 2003.<\/p>\n<p>The report also revealed that the average age of a first-time buyer has increased from 31 to 33 over the last decade.<\/p>\n<p>Despite government demands for more affordable housing to support greater home ownership the survey highlights that it is just as important that households on modest incomes, particularly those with children, don\u2019t miss out on the action.<\/p>\n<p>Campbell Robb, the chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cThese figures are a stark reminder that for millions of families and young people it\u2019s becoming utterly impossible to create a stable future in a place they can really call home.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInstead of being able to put down roots, more and more people are stuck spending vast amounts of their income on rent, while house prices continue to rocket out of reach.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDespite being in power for six years, this government has made little progress on the underlying cause of our housing crisis \u2013 the chronic shortage of genuinely affordable homes. It doesn\u2019t have to be like this, but things will only change when we start building homes that people on ordinary incomes can actually afford.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Housing minister Brandon Lewis said: \u201cIn 2010 there was a housing market where buyers couldn\u2019t buy, builders couldn\u2019t build and lenders couldn\u2019t lend.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur efforts are turning that around with more than 270,000 families helped into home ownership through government-backed schemes since 2010, while the number of new homes is up 25pc over the last year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve set out the boldest ambition for housing in a generation, doubling the budget so we can help a million more people into home ownership, while delivering a bigger, and better private rental sector.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As the arguments continue to rage the inevitable time lag in making good the huge short fall in new housing stocks suggests that family demand for rented accommodation will continue to increase in the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #993366;\">About Source<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>To get the best possible returns every element of your investment lifecycle needs to deliver.
