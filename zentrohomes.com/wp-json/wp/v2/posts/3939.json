The housing market is proving to be particularly robust. It\u2019s a similar story elsewhere in the developed world. In August Germany recorded house prices 11% higher than the year before.<\/p>\n<p>This rise in the market in the U.K. has been caused by four main catalysts:<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The stamp duty holiday<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A bottle neck of transactions as a result of lockdown.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ultra-low interest rates<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The changing requirements of homeowners and tenants.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will it last?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3827 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/1-400x400.png.png\" alt=\"Source Property Investments\" width=\"134\" height=\"134\" \/>There will undoubtedly be a correction in 2021 as the furlough scheme and stamp duty holiday comes to an end and unemployment rates are expected to be at their highest. More properties are likely to come onto the market and prices will fall.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3836 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Asset-1-400x400.png.png\" alt=\"Source Property Investments\" width=\"142\" height=\"142\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Savilles projects there will be no further growth in property prices in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0The Centre for Economics and Business Research is less optimistic and is predicting\u00a0a fall in average house prices next year, citing that the market is being artificially buoyed by the stamp duty holiday.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does this mean for investors?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>More than ever it is a reminder to invest for the long term: rises and falls in the market are to be expected and prepared for. Over time these fluctuations are ironed out and more often than not provide a good return.<\/p>\n<p>Savills projects the UK market will rise 20% in the next four years. Property is not a \u2018get rich quick\u2019 scheme - treat it like one at your peril. It is, however, a fantastic means to build wealth over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Should you invest now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In short, the current circumstances favour those who are already homeowners. if you are fortunate enough to be in this position, this may be the time to begin or build on your existing property portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>With low interest rates and mortgage lenders looking favourably on those who can make significant deposits, capital could be available for your investment.<\/p>\n<p>The stamp duty holiday also provides a nice upfront saving for investors that won\u2019t be available when the scheme comes to an end in March next year.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, low interest rates means that money deposited in the bank is actually losing value when inflation is taken into account. For many of our clients, investment is a smart play.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make the right investment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Given the current climate, it is more important than ever that you find the right investment. Covid has changed the goal posts dramatically: tenants are seeking more space, both inside and out. They are looking for a place to work from home and moving closer to the suburbs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-left\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQFl7mV6DvblHw\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1606953600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=egVC83L9NjL-_skOJsEIXEFkRAwhTqgnpaKuFdXh7Hc\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https:\/\/media-exp1.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4D12AQFl7mV6DvblHw\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1606953600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=egVC83L9NjL-_skOJsEIXEFkRAwhTqgnpaKuFdXh7Hc\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As travel restrictions remain in place, we are all looking to holiday in the U.K. instead of abroad.
