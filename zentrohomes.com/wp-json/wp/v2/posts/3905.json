We offered it to our family of investors in Aug 2017 with a projected return of 8.5%.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing all our apartments are fully occupied (managed by us on our clients\u2019 behalf) and our investors have received on average 8.8%* over the last three years.<\/p>\n<p>How have we done this?<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0<strong>Timing!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We chose Sheffield because it was an emerging city. Popular northern powerhouse cities, like Manchester and Birmingham, had already seen capital growth - and this was reflected in their less attractive yields.<\/p>\n<p>Getting into Sheffield at the right time gave us and our clients more scope for capital growth in the mid- to long-term. In the short term, yields were better here too.<\/p>\n<p>The price point (from \u00a390,000) was particularly attractive for first-time investors, and we helped numerous clients dip their toe into building a property portfolio with this development.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0<strong>Seeing the opportunity<\/strong>!<\/h3>\n<p>We spotted that there was very little provision in Sheffield for local young professionals and business travellers to the city. It was a gap in the market we wanted to fill. Sheffield is often perceived as a student city (it has a student population of 60,000) and developments are geared towards them.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-3716 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/sheffield-62-600x400.jpg.jpg\" alt=\"Fitzgerald, Sheffield\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p>75% of the apartments at the Fitzgerald are long term lets used by local people and the other 25% are luxury serviced apartments aimed at those visiting or working in the city. (These are performing even better returning almost 15%)<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0<strong>Location!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As with the success of any property investment, location was critical<\/p>\n<p>The apartments are equidistant between the city centre and the booming Kelham Island district, with its independent shops, bars, and cafes.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3907 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/SI_3-400x400.jpeg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/><br \/>\nThe Steelyard Kelham Photo courtesy of @cog_photo<\/p>\n<p>The business district, law courts, train station, and cultural destinations - like the Crucible Theatre and the O2 academy - are all a short walk from the apartments. There are multiple reasons for people to want to live or stay here.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst serviced apartments geared towards the student market have been severely effected by Covid 19 our occupancy rate shows that for our model the outbreak has caused a short term blip.<\/p>\n<p>It is an important reminder why we only consider long-term prospects, so we are able to withstand short term falls in the market. A stark reminder for anyone doing any sort of investment: spread the risk!<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0<strong>Long-term growth potential!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The proximity of the\u00a0\u00a3175 million West Bar Square development, granted outline planning consent in 2017, was also a major draw for us. In 2019 this became a compulsory purchase order and building work will commence later this year. Our clients are already in position to benefit from this huge investment in the surrounding area.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3909 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/3-424x400.jpeg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"424\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>If you\u2019d like any help starting or developing your property portfolio don\u2019t hesitate to <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/contact-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>get in contact with us here<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>*<\/strong>8.8% ROE on average over 3 years using a 75% loan to value buy to let mortgage at 3%.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sheffield Fitzgerald Our Sheffield Fitzgerald development has been a high performing project.
