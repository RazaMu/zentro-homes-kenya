Now, the industry is preparing for Phase 2 which is targeting new rules for Portfolio Landlords. (Portfolio landlords are those with four or more mortgaged buy-to-let properties.)<\/p>\n<h3>A Guide to the PRA\u2019s Portfolio Landlord Underwriting Changes<\/h3>\n<p>The new rules for Portfolio Landlords will require changes to the way in which buy-to-let mortgage applications are underwritten for Portfolio Landlords because the PRA has found that arrears rates increase as portfolio size grows.<br \/>\nFrom 30th September, any borrower who falls into the portfolio landlord category will be required to pass specialist affordability checks.<br \/>\nThe PRA has not prescribed a requirement, but rather has outlined that lenders should take into consideration a landlord\u2019s experience and record their full portfolio, rental income and outstanding mortgages, in addition to assets and liabilities.<br \/>\nThey should also take account of the merits of any new lending in accordance with the landlord\u2019s business plan, along with historical and future expected cash flow.<\/p>\n<h3>How will the new rules for Portfolio Landlords affect you?<\/h3>\n<p>If you are a portfolio landlord then from 30th September, lenders will need to ensure that you are not over-exposed and, as such, will stress your background portfolio \u2013 they will take your entire buy-to-let property portfolio into account when making a lending decision.<br \/>\nAlthough not all lenders have outlined how they will apply the guidelines, you can expect them to assess the following:<br \/>\n\u2022 Your property investment experience<br \/>\n\u2022 The total amount of mortgage borrowing you have across your whole portfolio<br \/>\n\u2022 Your assets and liabilities, including tax liability<br \/>\n\u2022 The merits of any new lending in the context of your existing buy-to-let portfolio, along with your business plan<br \/>\n\u2022 Historical and future expected cash flow from your portfolio<br \/>\n\u2022 Your income, both from property and elsewhere<br \/>\nYou should be prepared to be asked for your up-to-date property portfolio spreadsheet, a business plan, cash flow forecasts, your last three months\u2019 bank statements, submitted tax returns, and possibly income and expenditure statements for your portfolio.<\/p>\n<h3>How you can prepare for these new rules for Portfolio Landlords<\/h3>\n<p>If you already have four or more mortgaged buy-to-let properties and you plan to take out a mortgage for another buy-to-let property you should be ready for the additional tests.<br \/>\nTo be in the best position, you should get your paperwork in order and ready for the application process. As ever, it\u2019s important to keep your property portfolio spreadsheet up to date.<br \/>\nIf you are looking to review your portfolio, it\u2019s probably wise to do this sooner rather than later, so get ready for the changes.<\/p>\n<h3>Source<\/h3>\n<p>We are here to help if you need assistance in preparing for the new rules so please get in touch at <a href=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/contact-us\/\">Source Investments<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Phase 1 of the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) changes to buy-to-let mortgage lending were introduced in January 2017 and introduced stricter affordability tests, including a stress test on interest rate rises, for buy-to-let landlords.
