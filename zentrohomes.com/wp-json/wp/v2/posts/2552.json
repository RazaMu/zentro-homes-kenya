through to Clapham Junction either via Tooting Broadway (connected to London Underground) or via Balham (connected to both the main rail network and London Underground).<br \/>\nBranch one runs from Shepperton (London Underground) through Upper Halliford; Sunbury; Kempton Park; Hampton; Fulwell; Teddington (main line connections); Hampton Wick; Kingston (main line connections); Norbiton and then links up with Branch line two to go through New Malden (main line connections) and onto Raynes Park.<br \/>\nBranch two starts in Hampton Court and continues through Thames Ditton; Surbiton (main line connections) and Berrylands before linking with branch line one just before New Malden.<br \/>\nBranch three begins in Chessington South and proceeds through Chessington North; Tolworth; and Haldon Manor before linking with branch 4 just before Motspur Park (main line connections) and onto Raynes Park.<br \/>\nBranch four starts in Epsom (main line connections) and travels into London via Ewell West; Stoneleigh and Worcester Park before linking up with branch\u00a0line\u00a0three just before Motspur Park.<\/p>\n<h3>Northern Links<\/h3>\n<p>From Seven Sisters there will be a Crossrail 2 spur to Alexander Palace and New Southgate (both with main line connections) either via Turnpike Lane or Wood Green (both connected to London Underground).<br \/>\nFrom Tottenham Hale the route runs north through Northumberland Park; Angel Road; Ponders End; Brimsdown; Enfield Lock; Waltham Cross; Cheshunt (main line connections); Broxbourne (main line connections) and onwards via the existing national rail route.<\/p>\n<h3>Property Hotspots - London<\/h3>\n<p>Within\u00a0the central part of the Crossrail 2 route the following areas are likely to see good growth and strong demand.<\/p>\n<h4>Clapham Junction\/Battersea<\/h4>\n<p>Battersea - the home of Clapham Junction station - is already in the middle of a huge regeneration.\u00a0 Two new stations are planned for startup by 2020 at Nine Elms (London\u2019s biggest regeneration zone) and Battersea Power Station and in the longer-term the plan is to extend the Northern line to Clapham Junction.<br \/>\nAlready popular with renters, investors and homebuyers, we expect that as a result of Crossrail 2 demand in Battersea\u00a0will strengthen still further leading to increase in both property prices and rents.<br \/>\nCrossrail 2 will cut journey times into Victoria and Waterloo to around 5 minutes and also provide a route straight into central London itself.\u00a0 It is likely to spur further regeneration both around the station itself but also on surrounding areas where people currently commute into Vauxhall or Waterloo to change unto London Underground for onward travel to central London. Crossrail 2 will render such connections redundant.<\/p>\n<h4>Tottenham Hale<\/h4>\n<p>Currently not top of the list for attractiveness, Tottenham Hale does attract first time buyers and renters through its affordability (with 1 bedroom properties costing about \u00a3300,000) and quick journey time into Central London (roughly 15 minutes to the City on the underground.<br \/>\nAs one of the two northern termini on Crossrail 2 Tottenham Hale will have between 10 and 12 trains per hour in each direction operating directly to, and across, central London plus good onward links further north.\u00a0 As a result, the area is expected to undergo significant regeneration in addition to the work which is already underway.\u00a0 Currently there is a \u00a3110m investment being spent on a new underground, rail and bus station plus extensive road network improvements and public realm development which are expected to complete next year.<br \/>\nProperty prices are expected to rise considerably.<\/p>\n<h4>New Southgate<\/h4>\n<p>Currently New Southgate is a residential suburb popular with families because of its green spaces and good schools.<br \/>\nThe new Crossrail 2 station which is proposed will provide much faster journey times into central London and the West End and is likely to trigger regeneration in the area by providing the infrastructure needed to build new homes and create more jobs.<\/p>\n<h4>Tooting Broadway\/Balham<\/h4>\n<p>Once the decision is known whether Crossrail 2 will route through Balham or Tooting Broadway the chosen area is sure get a boost in terms of regeneration and property prices.<br \/>\nThe new speedy service will significantly cut journey times into central London with a resulting increase in appeal to young professionals who want a quick commute and affordable housing compared to neighbouring Battersea and Clapham.<\/p>\n<h4>Coming soon<\/h4>\n<p>In our next blog we will consider those areas in the outlying parts of the Crossrail 2 route that are also likely to attract keen interest and where good investment opportunities may exists.<\/p>\n<h4>Expertise<\/h4>\n<p>Our team of property experts have helped many new and existing landlords who are seeking to invest in buy to let residential property -
