Historical experience appears to bear this out; between the mid-1950s and 1990, the annual growth rate in house prices was negative in only one quarter,\u201d said the report.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut the myth of permanent price increases was first dispelled in the recession of the early 1990s and, then, during the global financial crisis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This situation indicates that housing policies overall need a rethink, the economists said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMarket crashes are hardly an optimal policy response to improving affordability, given the wider effects on the economy,\u201d they concluded.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf reliance on supply expansion is inadequate, then this implies the need for more integrated housing policies, where housing issues play a wider role in macroeconomic policies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The research reinforces the view held by many property experts that in the long-term property prices will inevitably rise because it seems that supply will always lag demand.<\/p>\n<h3>Need Advice?<\/h3>\n<p>For more information about investing in the property market contact our team of experts at <a href=\"https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/contact-us\/\">https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/contact-us\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The reason According to a study by economists at the University of Reading presented to the Royal Economic Society, house prices will rise faster than salary growth because Britain will never build enough houses to make property supply outstrip demand.
