From next month buy to let investors and companies will be charged an extra 3% across the board. (The shock decision to extend the additional tax to companies announced in last week\u2019s budget could also stall the evolution of the fledgling professional rental industry which had previously looked all set to transform the property market).<\/p>\n<p>With more than 54,000 homes costing a million or more planned for London over the next few years there are fears that the major developments at Battersea (3,500) Earls Court (7,500) and Nine Elms (18,000) will be undersold unless prices come down markedly.<\/p>\n<p>With an acute correction in prices being widely predicted many developers are currently actively seeking revised planning permission to cut flats in size and make them more affordable. This is good news for those seeking to invest in the \u201cmiddle market\u201d which has historically been under supplied. As developers shift their attention down from the top end and supply increases so bargains may become more available.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2412\" src=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/london-441853_1920.jpg\" alt=\"Opportunities\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1274\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Opportunities?<\/h3>\n<p>With the market currently in a state of limbo as many international investors hold off buying in London pending the outcome of the BREXIT referendum in June developers maybe keener to attract UK buyers with tempting offers.<\/p>\n<p>Now might therefore be a good time to look to take advantage of any attractive offers on the table.<\/p>\n<p>If you are thinking of investing in buy to let properties contact us for a free consultation.
