Since the turn of the century the city has been transformed to one where rental is becoming the norm.<\/p>\n<p>The analysis also reveals that all regions within the UK are expected to experience falling levels of home ownership and rising levels of private renting over the next 10 years, with Scotland and the north of England expected to see faster growth in private renting than the south, excluding London.<\/p>\n<p>According to Richard Parker, partner in PwC\u2019s housing sector team \u201cA number of factors are driving this predicted shift in tenure within the housing sector: a lack of new housing supply to meet increasing demand has pushed up prices to unaffordable levels for many, mortgage deposits require savings that are well out of the reach of first-time buyers and we\u2019re also seeing younger people increasingly showing a preference for high-quality rental housing. As a result we\u2019re now seeing a growing number of investors putting significant funds into the development of quality, private market rental accommodation, which they are viewing as a long-term revenue stream\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>As homeownership increasingly comes to be seen as an unaffordable luxury rents in London are also expected to rise from already high costs \u2013 further reducing the chance of saving for a down payment.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2268\" src=\"https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/london-eye-945511_1280.jpg\" alt=\"Tenant\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>London moving into line<\/h3>\n<p>In this respect London is moving into line with major cities in many countries such as Germany and Switzerland for example that seem to function pretty well with far larger private rental sectors than the U.K. \u00a0However a major reason why these countries\u2019 housing markets work is because tenants have far more and better protections and generally better rental housing standards.<\/p>\n<p>In the U.K., tenancies last on average for just 12 months and in a seller\u2019s market like London, rental apartment quality can often be poor. If living conditions in the city aren\u2019t to be permanently downgraded, something will have to change to make renting a better, more secure option. As PwC partner David Snell notes in the report \u201cWith around 60% of Londoners predicted to be renting by 2025\u2026policy will need to adapt. This could include encouraging a better quality of private rented accommodation, including longer tenure periods and more rental properties designed for families.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Tenants deserve high quality<\/h3>\n<p>As London\u2019s housing balance continues to tip towards renting so tenants should be in a position to put increasing pressure on landlords to create the changes and improvements traditionally enjoyed by their counterparts in Germany. There\u00a0the rental tenants\u2019 bloc is larger, wealthier and better connected, and thus more able to petition for its own interests.<\/p>\n<h3>About Source<\/h3>\n<p>To get the best possible returns every element of your investment lifecycle needs to deliver.
