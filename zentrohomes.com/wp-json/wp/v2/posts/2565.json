'Investments in, or secured against, residential property are generally seen as the ones that will deliver the strongest returns over time.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Kate Smith, Head of Pensions at Aegon, has a different view 'Recently we\u2019ve seen a lot of conflicting commentary about saving for retirement through a property or a pension. The question of returns is complex but we\u2019d argue that for most people their property is a home not a source of retirement income.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Rising prices and rents<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">In September, the ONS revealed UK property prices increased by 8.3 per cent in the year to July 2016, after years of similar annual increases.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The average trend in rents also continues upwards, increasing by 2.3% in the year to August.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">This latest research shows that the British love affair with bricks and mortar shows no sign of abating and that property investment for retirement continues to grow in popularity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">If you are considering investment in property please get in touch with our team of experts at <a href=\"https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/contact-us\/\">https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/contact-us\/<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Property investment for retirement This month\u2019s survey by the Office for National Statistics reveals that property investment for retirement is the most popular form of investment.\u00a0\u00a0 45% of respondents\u00a0said that property was the best investment for retirement, a rise from 40 per cent in 2010.\u00a0\u00a0 This is almost twice as many as the 25% who [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":2569,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"content-type":"","inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1,17,14,20,25],"tags":[18,13,21,16],"class_list":["post-2565","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-blog","category-buy","category-investment","category-letting","category-insights-sourcing","tag-buy-to-let-investment","tag-investment","tag-property-investments","tag-source"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v24.6 -
