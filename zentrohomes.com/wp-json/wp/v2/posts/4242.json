However, where investors find real value, is areas with runway for growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we mean by this, is somewhere with potential (and often plans for) considerable investment or regeneration. This allows investors to capitalise on lower purchase costs, with rental prices and property values then surging when the area becomes more convenient and desirable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we initially looked at Brickworks, the surrounding area was entirely industrial. However, the city centre was emerging as an urban capital - with a redbrick University, a thriving social culture and huge regeneration projects on the cards. In particular the \u00a3900 million Central Quay redevelopment, located just two minutes away, included offices, hotels, restaurants, retail units, a multi-storey car park and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The completion of the development, surge in housing demand and the above regeneration, is reflected in today\u2019s increased rental values.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Tenant Opportunity<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardiff is set to see population growth exceeding other major UK cities such as London, Manchester and Liverpool by 2034. With this, comes an increased demand for housing, employment and education.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the population projections and the emergence of the city centre, there was little living provision for young professionals. A large proportion of urban and suburban areas are populated with students, with housing opportunities marketed towards them.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brickworks offered one, two and three bedroom industrial style apartments with balconies\/terraces, a high quality finish and a communal rooftop - very much tailored to the emerging young professional population.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br \/>\nTiming\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going hand-in-hand with the above, timing was a huge contributor to the success of this project. We had recognised the potential of the area before regeneration plans had come into fruition, allowing investors to capitalise on a lower point of entry and good prospects for future yields.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, our relationship with the developers allowed us to secure great off-plan units\u00a0 - with properties valued in line with the area pre-regeneration.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>In it for the long run<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with all of our investments, we advised investors to hold for a minimum of 5 years, to allow the investment to mature and generate the best returns possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, with increasing demand on the rental market across the UK and future house price predictions, the prospects of this investment for those in the position to hold on over an even longer period, are even more promising. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start leveraging opportunities and building your portfolio today. <a href=\"https:\/\/sourceinvestments.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact us here<\/a>.<\/span><\/i><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of our core values is sustainable wealth creation, or in other words, balancing yields and capital growth.
