font-family: Calibri;\">What\u2019s the impact of the election on the housing market and our financial prospects?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #1f3763; font-family: Calibri Light; font-size: medium;\">Property<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The political uncertainty resulting from the election of a minority government might encourage more of us to put off any thought of moving for a few months.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">This would add to a property slow down which has already led to three consecutive months of falling house prices and the longest period of down turn since 2009.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">However, dropping prices present good opportunities for those willing to speculate and the weaker pound will also be attractive to foreign buyers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">For those people who are confident about their overall financial position this represents a good opportunity to trade in a less crowded market place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #1f3763; font-family: Calibri Light; font-size: medium;\">Private Landlords<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Still reeling from the Tories policy changes in 2016 which stripped tax benefits, loaded extra stamp duty and removed wear and tear allowance private landlords will be hoping for some respite in the short term.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Some post-election policy reversal is probably too much to hope for but given the overall political and financial uncertainty (plus Brexit) landlords should at least be spared any further negative changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #1f3763; font-family: Calibri Light; font-size: medium;\">Rental Sector<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Although there has been an increased focus on the rental market with the introduction of build-to-rent developments particularly in London, there remains a significant shortfall of good quality and affordable rental accommodation.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Following their election the new government will need to focus on ensuring that the UK has a balanced rental sector that attracts landlords and investors whilst also looking after the legitimate rights of tenants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3097\" src=\"https:\/\/zentrohomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/people-2557396_960_720-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #1f3763; font-family: Calibri Light; font-size: medium;\">The Young<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The young certainly made their feelings known through the ballot box at the election so maybe the government will heed some of their concerns.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">An extension of the Help to Buy scheme looks a distinct possibility with the inclusion of older properties and stamp duty reductions possibly on the agenda.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #1f3763; font-family: Calibri Light; font-size: medium;\">Mortgages <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">With so much uncertainty around because of the election result it is hard to know what will happen to mortgage rates.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">One school of thought is that now is a good time to take advantage of the several cheap deals that are available before they disappear.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Others consider that the likelihood of any significant rise in interest rates is distinctly unlikely and that the cheap deals will be around for some time to come.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Indeed, if mortgage demand continues to fall there may be better deals and incentives yet to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;
