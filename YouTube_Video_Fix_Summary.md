# YouTube Video Implementation Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
The YouTube video implementation in the apartment details page was only checking a limited set of field names for YouTube URLs, missing important fields used by the admin panel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `renderVideoPlayer()` method in `apartment-details.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const youtubeUrl = apartment.youtubeUrl || apartment.media?.youtubeUrl || apartment.youtube_url;
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Try all possible field names for YouTube URLs (including virtual_tour_url which is used by admin)
const youtubeUrl = apartment.youtubeUrl || 
                  apartment.youtube_url || 
                  apartment.virtual_tour_url || 
                  apartment.youtube || 
                  apartment.media?.youtubeUrl || 
                  apartment.media?.virtualTour ||
                  apartment.virtualTour ||
                  apartment.virtualTourUrl;
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to show which fields are being checked:
- `apartment.youtubeUrl`
- `apartment.youtube_url` 
- `apartment.virtual_tour_url` (KEY FIELD - used by admin panel)
- `apartment.youtube`
- `apartment.media?.youtubeUrl`
- `apartment.media?.virtualTour`
- `apartment.virtualTour`
- `apartment.virtualTourUrl`

## Key Improvements

1. **Database Field Compatibility**: Now properly checks `virtual_tour_url` which is the primary field used by the Railway database integration
2. **Admin Panel Compatibility**: Matches all field names used by the admin panel for storing YouTube URLs
3. **Better Debug Information**: Console logs show exactly which fields are being checked and their values
4. **Fallback Support**: Comprehensive fallback chain ensures videos are found regardless of field naming conventions

## Expected Behavior

When a property has a YouTube URL stored in any of these fields:
- The video section will appear underneath the property gallery
- YouTube embed will load properly with responsive styling
- Debug logs will show which field contained the URL
- "Watch on YouTube" link will work correctly

## Files Modified

- `zentrohomes.com/js/apartment-details.js` - Updated `renderVideoPlayer()` method (lines 390-424)

## Files Verified (Already Correct)

- `zentrohomes.com/apartment-details.html` - Contains proper `<div id="property-video-section">`
- `zentrohomes.com/css/video-player.css` - Contains all necessary styling for video player
- Admin panel integration properly uses `virtual_tour_url` field

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Add a YouTube URL to a property using the admin panel
2. View the property details page
3. Check browser console for debug logs showing field detection
4. Verify video appears below the property gallery
5. Verify video plays correctly and "Watch on YouTube" link works
