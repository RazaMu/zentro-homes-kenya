ADMIN PANEL FIXES COMPLETED
============================

ISSUES FIXED:
=============

1. ✅ REMOVED GALLERY IMAGES SECTION
   - Deleted gallery images upload area from property form
   - Removed gallery images preview area
   - Removed hidden gallery input field

2. ✅ REMOVED IMAGE URL INPUT
   - Deleted the "Or enter image URL" fallback option
   - Simplified to main image upload only

3. ✅ FIXED SUPABASE CONNECTION ISSUE
   - Problem: Admin script was looking for window.supabaseManager
   - Solution: Changed all references to supabaseManager (global variable)
   - Fixed in all functions: waitForSupabase, loadProperties, saveProperty, etc.

4. ✅ MEDIA MANAGER SCRIPT LOADED
   - Added supabase-media-manager.js to admin HTML
   - Now available for actual file uploads

CONSOLE LOG ANALYSIS:
====================
- ✅ "Supabase connection successful" - Database connection works
- ❌ "Supabase not available, using local data" - SHOULD BE FIXED NOW
- ❌ Missing image files (zentro-favicon.png, unsplash.jpg) - Normal for file:// protocol

CURRENT STATUS:
===============
- Admin panel should now connect to Supabase properly
- File upload should work for main images and videos
- Properties can be saved to database with media URLs
- Simplified UI with only essential upload options

TEST NOW:
=========
1. Refresh admin page
2. Check console - should show "Loaded X properties from database"
3. Try adding a property with main image
4. File should upload and property should save

The connection issue should be resolved!
