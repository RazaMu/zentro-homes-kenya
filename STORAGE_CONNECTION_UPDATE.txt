SUPABASE STORAGE CONNECTION STRING UPDATE
==========================================

Your PostgreSQL connection string for storage:
postgresql://postgres.yqskldskeokvgigyrfnw:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres

WHERE TO ADD THIS:
==================

File: zentrohomes.com/js/supabase-config.js

ADD THIS NEW SECTION after the storage configuration (around line 34):

```javascript
  },
  
  // Database connection for storage operations
  database: {
    connectionString: 'postgresql://postgres.yqskldskeokvgigyrfnw:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres'
  }
};
```

REPLACE [YOUR-PASSWORD] with your actual database password.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
===============
The current Media Manager uses the Supabase JavaScript client (which uses URL + anonKey) for storage operations. The PostgreSQL connection string is typically used for:

1. Server-side operations
2. Admin functions that need elevated privileges
3. Direct database connections

For browser-based file uploads, the current setup should work with just the URL and anonKey you already have configured.

If you need to use the direct database connection for server-side storage operations, you would need to:
1. Create a server-side endpoint/API
2. Use a PostgreSQL client library
3. Handle the connection securely on the server

Let me know if you want me to help set up server-side storage operations using this connection string!
